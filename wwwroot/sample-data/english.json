  "About2": "A special thanks to my friend and colleague Carlos Rueda Valenzuela for suggesting the name for the application. In Maltese, 'mela' is used very often so Carlos suggested to combine 'mela' and 'app' as the name.",
  "About1": "Mela! The App! I wrote this application as I need to learn Maltese language. For me, a typical European, Maltese words are very difficult to memorise since 60-70% of that language is Arabic. English is not my native language either, thus I came up with the idea to learn trough flashcards but using my native Serbian words. I have found some flashcards programs on Linux but none of them had the simple approach that I want and quiz the way I wanted. In that case, I will make my own free and open source application.",
  "Welcome1": "Welcome to Melapp!",
  "Welcome2": "This application is a typical flashcards application where user has to input manually collections and then play quizzes to learn words in a fun way!",
